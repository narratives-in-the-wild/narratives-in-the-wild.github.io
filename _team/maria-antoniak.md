Maria is a computational social scientist specializing in narrative analysis and online communities. Her research focuses on developing collaborative annotation frameworks to understand how stories spread and evolve across social media platforms.

Her work bridges natural language processing, digital humanities, and community-engaged research, with a particular interest in addressing misinformation through narrative understanding rather than traditional fact-checking approaches.
