<!-- # Narratives in the Wild -->

# *A narrative annotation and observation tool for researchers studying social media*

We're a research team building a collaborative annotation infrastructure to identify and label the "big, sticky stories" that spread across social media platforms. Instead of fact-checking individual posts, we focus on understanding the underlying narrative patterns that contribute to misinformation ecosystems.

Our open research platform brings together researchers, community members, and users to collaboratively annotate narrative patterns on Bluesky, a new social media platform, creating transparent datasets for interdisciplinary research. 

Based at the at the Pioneer Centre for AI in Copenhagen, Denmark, our experimental project focuses on strengthening democracy through new interactive tools for social media.
