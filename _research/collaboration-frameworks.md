Building bridges between researchers, community members, and social media users to create inclusive narrative research.
<!--more-->

Our collaboration frameworks are designed to break down traditional silos between academic research and community participation, enabling truly interdisciplinary and inclusive research on narrative patterns.

# Stakeholder Integration

Our project brings together diverse perspectives and expertise:

## Research Communities

- **Computational Social Scientists**: Network analysis and machine learning experts
- **Folklorists**: Traditional narrative pattern researchers  
- **Digital Humanities Scholars**: Text analysis and cultural studies researchers
- **Communication Studies**: Media framing and sensemaking experts

## Community Partners

- **Journalists**: Professional fact-checkers and media literacy educators
- **Community Organizers**: Grassroots advocates and social media moderators
- **Educators**: Media literacy and critical thinking instructors
- **General Users**: Bluesky community members and content creators

## Collaborative Processes

### Research Proposal System

Teams can propose new annotation projects through a structured process:

1. **Topic Selection**: Identify emerging narrative patterns worth studying
2. **Label Set Design**: Develop appropriate narrative categories
3. **Community Review**: Public feedback and refinement period
4. **Implementation**: Launch annotation infrastructure

### Consensus Building

Our frameworks emphasize democratic participation:

- **Multi-stakeholder Review**: All perspectives included in design decisions
- **Transparent Governance**: Public documentation of all process decisions
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on community feedback
- **Conflict Resolution**: Structured processes for addressing disagreements

## Knowledge Sharing

### Open Data Practices

All research outputs follow open science principles:

- **Immediate Availability**: Datasets released as annotations are created
- **Multiple Formats**: Data accessible to both technical and non-technical users  
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive metadata and methodology descriptions
- **Reproducibility**: Full pipeline documentation for research verification

### Community Education

We provide resources to support meaningful participation:

- **Training Materials**: Guides for understanding narrative analysis
- **Best Practices**: Documentation of effective annotation strategies
- **Regular Workshops**: Community skill-building sessions
- **Mentorship Programs**: Pairing experienced and new annotators

> Our goal is to create a new model for community-engaged research that genuinely includes affected communities as partners rather than subjects of study.
