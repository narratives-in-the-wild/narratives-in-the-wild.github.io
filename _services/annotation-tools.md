Our annotation tools leverage Bluesky's moderation infrastructure to create an intuitive, community-driven labeling system.

Built on the open-source Ozone library and AT Protocol, our tools enable researchers and community members to collaboratively identify and label narrative patterns in social media content.

# Platform Features

Our annotation platform is designed around Bluesky's unique affordances for open, collaborative moderation:

## Moderation Services

Bluesky labels can be designed and applied by any user who chooses to run a moderation service. Other users may then subscribe to any of these services, which can hide, warn, or simply display a label for relevant contentâ€”all labels are opt-in.

## Open Source Foundation

Built on the open-source Ozone library, our tools provide:

- **Transparent Infrastructure**: All moderation actions visible to the community
- **Portable Data**: Built on AT Protocol for data portability
- **Community Control**: Users maintain full agency over their content

## Annotation Workflow

Our tools support a structured annotation process:

### 1. Content Discovery
- Custom feeds for topic-focused annotation
- Real-time flagging on personal feeds  
- Keyword and hashtag search capabilities

### 2. Collaborative Labeling
- Free-text rationale submission
- Structured narrative category assignment
- Consensus-building through discussion

### 3. Quality Control
- Trusted annotator review queues
- Iterative label refinement
- Community feedback mechanisms

## Label Categories

We support multiple narrative labeling frameworks:

| Category | Description | Use Cases |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- |
| **Tropes** | Recurring themes and motifs | Story pattern analysis |
| **Frames** | Perspective and emphasis patterns | Media analysis |
| **Character Roles** | Hero, villain, victim dynamics | Actor representation studies |
| **Moral Foundations** | Care, fairness, loyalty dimensions | Value system research |

### Research Integration

Our tools are designed for seamless integration with research workflows:

- **Real-time Export**: Datasets available immediately upon labeling
- **Version Control**: Historical labeling data preserved
- **Multi-format Support**: CSV, JSON, and academic citation formats
- **Privacy Compliance**: URL-based sharing preserves user agency

> All annotation work is done publicly and transparently, allowing the broader community to observe, critique, and contribute to the research process.
