Our research methodology combines computational folkloristics, sensemaking theory, and collaborative annotation to understand how narratives spread through social media ecosystems.

# Theoretical Foundations

Our approach draws from three key research areas to address the challenge of misinformation in online spaces:

## Computational Folkloristics

The field of computational folkloristics uses network analysis and natural language processing methods to measure and analyze how conspiracy theory narratives spread online, within and across social media platforms. This approach helps us detect "underlying narrative frameworks" and the connections between them.

## Sensemaking Research

Sensemaking research examines how people construct shared knowledge. When this process goes awry, "facts" are not always the issue but rather rumors and conspiracy theories that spread higher level "misinterpretations and mischaracterizations."

> Having access to high quality frames and being able to apply frames appropriately could be the difference between experts and those more susceptible to misinformation.

## Collaborative Annotation

We leverage the wisdom of crowds through collaborative tagging systems, similar to successful projects like Community Notes on Twitter/X, but focused specifically on narrative elements rather than factual accuracy.

## Our Process

Our annotation pipeline follows a structured four-step process:

| Step | Process | Participants |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| **Propose** | Research teams propose topic-specific annotation tasks | Researchers, Community Leaders |
| **Flag** | Community members identify relevant posts | Annotators, General Users |
| **Label** | Trusted members assign narrative categories | Expert Annotators |
| **Share** | Open datasets become available | All Researchers, Builders |

### Research Design Principles

1. **Open and Transparent**: All work done publicly on Bluesky
2. **Community-Centered**: Users maintain agency over their content
3. **Interdisciplinary**: Designed for collaboration across research fields
4. **Scalable**: Built on Bluesky's moderation infrastructure

### Data Governance

We preserve users' agency over their content by sharing URLs or IDs that link back to posts rather than raw content. This ensures that user edits or deletions are reflected in new analyses while maintaining research integrity.
